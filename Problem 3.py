'''
Play around with the lay-up values on line 52 to run through iterations on this one.  I'm just leaving it on the one
I found to be the last one needed but it's all based on initial guesses so you'll want to run through a few.  Use the
carpet plots to find your values for E_xx and G_xy and plug those in on line 41 & 42
